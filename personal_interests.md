I am an Eagle Scout and was in scouting from when I was little in Cub Scouts. I did my Eagle Project 
with the Lions Club in North Kingstown RI. I held a used eyeglasses drive where people donated their 
old glasses and sunglasses so they can be recycled and made for less fortunate people in the Rhode Island community. 

I love to play golf in my free time. 

I am very interested in cryptography and like to write simple ciphers.

I have always liked to play chess, I think it is a fascinating game and it is so complex and always a mind bender. 

Skiing is something I have always done with my family in the winters and I love it.
