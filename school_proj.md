**CATSMEOW Design Project**

My team was tasked with re-designing a CATSMEOW. The CATSMEOW is a blender assembly that is mounted onto the top of a mason jar
and has a main function of whipping cream. The original design had many issues including adesive wear, torque, gearing, and just overall design.

My team and I came up with a new design for the CATSMEOW that was able to whip cream in 90 seconds when tested at the end of the year.

**Medtronic Robot Design project**

The senior project that I have choosen to work on this academic year is sponsored by Medtronic. My team and I will be working with them
to develop a robot that can tie simple knots, using Arduino microcontrollers and other electromechanical components. The robot will pick up pre-cut
strands of suture and tie the simple knot. This will improve consistency of the knots, and the efficiency of the process. _More info and updates
soon to come as the project progresses_
