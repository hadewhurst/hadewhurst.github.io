**CATSMEOW Design Project**

My team was tasked with re-designing a CATSMEOW. The CATSMEOW is a blender assembly that is mounted onto the top of a mason jar
and has a main function of whipping cream. The original design had many issues including adesive wear, torque, gearing, and just overall design.

My team and I came up with a new design for the CATSMEOW that was able to whip cream in 90 seconds when tested at the end of the year.
