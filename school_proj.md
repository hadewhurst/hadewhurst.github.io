**Medtronic Robot Design project**

The senior project that I have choosen to work on this academic year is sponsored by Medtronic. My team and I will be working with them
to develop a robot that can tie simple knots, using Arduino microcontrollers and other electromechanical components. The robot will pick up pre-cut
strands of suture and tie the simple knot. This will improve consistency of the knots, and the efficiency of the process. 

_More info and updates soon to come as the project progresses_

**CATSMEOW Design Project**

My team was tasked with re-designing a CATSMEOW. The CATSMEOW is a blender assembly that is mounted onto the top of a mason jar
and has a main function of whipping cream. The original design had many issues including adesive wear, torque, gearing, and just overall design.

My team and I came up with a new design for the CATSMEOW that was able to whip cream in 90 seconds when tested at the end of the year.

**Circuits Design Project**

Worked in a team to design, simulate, prototype, and fabricate a DC, multi-output power circuit. The PCB needed to power a project that we completed
earlier in the semester that required 9V, an Xbox controller that required 3V, and also an LED. We used softwares such as MultiSim to simulate the circuit
before we sent it out to be printed, also Pad2Pad to draw the desired PCB and have it manufactured. We used tools such as the Elvis II breadboard to 
conduct initial reasearch into the circuit and different parts needed. Once the PCB's arrived we soldered them by hand and tested the boards to check for
functionality. Ours Worked! Check it out [here](/assets/img/CircuitProj.jpg)


**Thermodynamics Combined Power Cycle Project**

In this project my team and I used MiniRefProp and MATLAB to design a [Combined Power Cycle](/assets/img/Thermo_Proj.PNG). We analyzed the Brayton cycle combined with
the Rankine cycle in MATLAB to find the optimal temperatures and pressures needed at the different states of the cycle to maximize the power
output. We were also tasked with choosing a gas turbine out of a list with all different operating specs. Take a look at some of the [code](/assets/img/Thermo_Code.PNG)
