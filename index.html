Hello my name is Harrison Dewhurst and I am currently a senior at Quinnipiac Univeristy studying Mechanical Engineering 
and minoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.
I think it is facinating to bring hardware to life using software. Please read about my work experience below and my school 
project in the tab above.
