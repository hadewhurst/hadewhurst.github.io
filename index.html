Welcome! My name is Harrison Dewhurst. Currently, I am a senior at <a href="https://www.qu.edu/" target="_blank">Quinnipiac University</a> University finishing up my studies in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.
These two topics especially interest me because of the endless potential they can have when combined. I am a dedicated, hard worker with the drive to succeed at anything
I put my mind to. In my free time, I enjoy chess, golf and skiing with my family. Please see below for my relevant work experience and up to date resume.
