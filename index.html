Hello my name is Harrison Dewhurst and I am currently a senior at <a href="https://www.qu.edu/">Quinnipaic Univeristy</a> studying Mechanical Engineering 
and minoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.
I think it is facinating to bring hardware to life using software. Please read about my work experience below and my school 
projects in the tab above. <br>
