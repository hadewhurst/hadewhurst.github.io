Over the summer of 2020, I had the opportunity to complete a remote summer internship with Pfizer Inc. During my time here, I was working within Pfizer Digital under Enterprise Platforms & Security (EP&S) Secure Network Services team. This area is mainly responsible for providing the necessary data analytics to the neighboring cyber security team. Throughout the summer I worked in data repository and dashboarding applications such as Splunk and Tableau. Using these tools, I successfully identified discrepancies in the data lake, and wrote code to change the data before the crucial next step of data analysis.
