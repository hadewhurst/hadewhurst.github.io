During the summer of 2019 I worked at Boothroyd Dewhurst Inc. (BDI) in Wakefield, RI. Here, I supported the Research and Development manager, Brian Rapoza. I collaborated with Brian to write Excel based macros to develop a cost model for the metal extrusion manufacturing process that BDI was implementing into their software (DFMA). We were looking to implement a way to check if the DFMA software was “correct” when performing cost modeling using metal extrusion. The Excel Macros I developed is the tool they used . Here is where my interest peaked in the combination of programming and mechanical engineering. This then sparked my excitement into computer science, and resulted in a minor at Quinnipiac University. <br>
