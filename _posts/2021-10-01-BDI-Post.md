During the summer of 2019 I worked for Boothroyd Dewhurst Inc. (BDI) under the research and development manager, Brian Rapoza. I worked with Brian to write Excel based macros
that developed a cost model for the metal extrusion manufacturing process that BDI was implementing into their software (DFMA). We needed a way to check
if the DFMA software was "correct" when performing cost modeling using metal extrusion. The Excel Macros I developed is the tool they used. This sparked 
my interest in programming and computer science and launched me into my computer science minor at Quinnipiac University. <br>
