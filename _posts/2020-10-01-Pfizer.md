title: Pfizer Inc.

---

During the summer of 2020 I was fortunate to work at Pfizer Inc. remotly out of Collegeville PA. I was working withing Pfizer Digital and 
more specifically in the Data Analytics team that provides necessary analytics to the Cyber Security division at Pfizer. Throughout the summer
I was working in applications like Splunk and Tableau. Writing regex and other code to filter and change data sources in Splunk, and creating
the necessary dashboards in Tableau to display the information that I found. By the end of the summer I was able to say I had identified 
discrepencies in the data lake, and wrote code to change the data before it gets to the data analysts.
